# TODO: This cops checks the indentation of the first key in a hash literal
#   where the opening brace and the first key are on separate lines. The other keys'
#   indentations are handled by the AlignHash cop

# TODO: Hash literals that are arguments in a method call with parentheses,
#   and where the opening curly brace of the hash is on the same line as the
#   opening parenthesis of the method call, shall have their first key indented
#   one step (two spaces) more than the position inside the opening parenthesis.

# TODO: Other hash literals shall have their first key indented one step more
#   than the start of the line where the opening curly brace is.
